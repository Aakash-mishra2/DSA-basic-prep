// given list of 'n' strings s0, s1, s2, ... sN-1, each consisting of digits and spaces, the number
// of spaces is the same for each entry, the goal is to implement a variation of a sort command. None
// of the strings contains consecutive spaces. Also, no string starts with a space nor ends with it.
// spaces are used to divide string into columns, which can be used as keys in comparisions.
